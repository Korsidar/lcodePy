# lcodePy


LCODE is free software for simulations of
particle beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration.
It is based on the quasistatic approximation.


So far it is new and experimental software.
This is a python rewrite of an old C version.
Here we also add 3d geometry.

You may also be looking for more mature 2D version of LCODE
at http://lcode.info/ instead.
